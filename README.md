Odin Project Google Homepage

A recreation of the Google Homepage using HTML & CSS. It took much more time than I expected. I actually created and deleted it about 3 times before landing on this one. This took a few hours to complete using a combiniation of knowledge from the Odin Project, FreeCodeCamp, W3Schools, Google, YouTube, various books on HTML/CSS, and patience. 

I actually quit and moved on for a few weeks while digesting the information. I am quite satisfied with the product.
